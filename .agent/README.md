# Windsurf / Antigravity Rules "v5"

🇬🇧 English Documentation

[🌏 Back to Top](../README.md) | [🇯🇵 日本語](../ja/README.md)

This repository manages custom instructions for Windsurf and Antigravity.

> **Note**: For the Cursor version, see the separate repository [kinopeee/cursorrules](https://github.com/kinopeee/cursorrules).

## Premise

- This `v5` is a set of custom instructions optimized for Windsurf and Antigravity.
- For the agent to operate autonomously (without human intervention), each editor's settings must be configured appropriately.
- See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for the latest updates.

## Overview

- After the release of AI agent features, I noticed a recurring issue: insufficient analytical rigor. I began crafting custom instructions to better draw out the model's inherent analytical ability (originally Claude 3.5 Sonnet at the time).
- The early themes were improving analytical capability and autonomous execution. Later iterations also targeted preventing duplicate module/resource generation, unintended design changes by the AI, and infinite loops in error handling. These efforts, combined with model refreshes and performance gains, have produced reasonable results.
- The focus of this version upgrade is GPT-5.1 optimization:
    1. We create a checklist-style execution plan first, then verify completion item-by-item for a more disciplined process.
    1. Tasks are classified into Lightweight, Standard, and Critical levels, with simplified reporting for lightweight tasks and more thorough processes for heavier ones.
    1. Independent tasks are executed in parallel to improve throughput.
- In addition, this version codifies detailed tooling policies (e.g., always read files before editing, use appropriate edit tools for modifications, and run terminal commands only when necessary with safe flags) so the agent executes tasks with consistent safeguards.
- `v5` was initially created with Anthropic Prompt Generator and has since gone through cycles of evaluation by contemporary models and practical improvements. When customizing, we recommend having your chosen AI evaluate it as well.
- For detailed updates, including task classification, error handling tiers, and tooling policies, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

- This repository itself also serves as a best-practice example, providing rule files for commit/PR messages and workflow command templates for commit, push, and PR creation.

## Usage

### Windsurf

1. If `.windsurf/rules` does not exist yet, create the folder.
2. Copy the required rule files from `ja/.windsurf/rules/` or `en/.windsurf/rules/`.
3. To use workflows, copy them to `.windsurf/workflows/`.

### Antigravity

1. If `.agent/rules` does not exist yet, create the folder.
2. Copy the required rule files from `ja/.agent/rules/` or `en/.agent/rules/`.
3. To use workflows, copy them to `.agent/workflows/`.

### Common Notes

- Because their application condition is `trigger: always_on`, they will be referenced in subsequent chats as long as they exist at the designated path.
- You may want to adjust this setting based on your preferred language and whether you want the test rules enabled by default.

For the division of responsibilities and usage patterns between rule files and workflows, see [doc/rules-and-workflows.md](doc/rules-and-workflows.md).

### Guardrail-related files

The following files are available for both Windsurf (`.windsurf/rules/`) and Antigravity (`.agent/rules/`).

- `commit-message-format.md`  
  - **Role**: Defines the commit message format (prefix, summary, bullet-list body) and prohibited patterns.
  - **Characteristics**: Based on Conventional Commits, with additional guidelines such as `language`-based language selection and diff-based message generation.

- `pr-message-format.md`  
  - **Role**: Defines the format for PR titles and bodies (prefix-style titles and structured sections such as Overview, Changes, Tests) and prohibited patterns.
  - **Characteristics**: Aligns PR messages with the commit message conventions and encourages structured descriptions that facilitate review and understanding of change intent.

- `test-strategy.md`  
  - **Role**: Defines test strategy rules for test implementation and maintenance, including equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, and coverage requirements.
  - **Purpose**: Serves as a quality guardrail by requiring corresponding automated tests whenever meaningful changes are made to production code, where reasonably feasible.

- `prompt-injection-guard.md`  
  - **Role**: Defines defense rules against **context injection attacks from external sources (RAG, web, files, API responses, etc.)**.
  - **Contents**: Describes guardrails such as restrictions on executing commands originating from external data, the Instruction Quarantine mechanism, the `SECURITY_ALERT` format, and detection of user impersonation attempts.
  - **Characteristics**: Does not restrict the user's own direct instructions; only malicious commands injected via external sources are neutralized.
  - **Note**: This file has `trigger: always_on` set in its metadata, but users can still control when these rules are applied via the editor's UI settings. See the [operational guide](doc/prompt-injection-guard.md) for details on handling false positives.

- `planning-mode-guard.md` **(Antigravity only)**
  - **Role**: A guardrail to prevent problematic behaviors in Antigravity's Planning Mode.
  - **Issues addressed**:
    - Transitioning to the implementation phase without user instruction
    - Responding in English even when instructed in another language (e.g., Japanese)
  - **Contents**: In Planning Mode, only analysis and planning are performed; file modifications and command execution are prevented without explicit user approval. Also encourages responses in the user's preferred language.
  - **Characteristics**: Placed only in `.agent/rules/`; not used in Windsurf.

- `doc/custom_instruction_plan_prompt_injection.md`  
  - **Role**: Design and threat analysis document for external context injection defense.
  - **Contents**: Organizes attack categories (A-01–A-09) via external sources, corresponding defense requirements (R-01–R-08), design principles for the external data control layer, and validation/operations planning.
  - **Update**: Fully revised in November 2024 to focus on external-source attacks.

## Notes

- If there are instructions in User Rules or Memories that conflict with v5, the model may become confused and effectiveness may decrease. Please check the contents carefully.
