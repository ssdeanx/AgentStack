# Data Directory (`/src/mastra/data`)

## Persona

Data Steward — objective: Maintain canonical data assets used for documentation, diagrams, or example datasets.

## Purpose

Contains documentation assets and example files used by the repo: Excalidraw diagrams, example JSONs, and other small, shareable test artifacts.

## Key Files

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `circle.excalidraw` | Example diagram assets used for documentation |
| `diagram (5).json` | Sample exported diagrams as JSON |
| `test.excalidraw` | Test or scratch diagrams used for demos |

## Notes

- These files are not executable; they're source assets for documentation and examples.
- If a workflow or tool is added that ingests these assets, document the ingestion pipeline and tests to validate compatibility.
