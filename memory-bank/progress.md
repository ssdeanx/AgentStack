## Tooling Hardening **[Synced Dec 12]**

- **Semantic tools runtime fixes**
    - `src/mastra/tools/semantic-utils.ts`: removed CommonJS `require('fs')` usage (repo is ESM) and added `unref()` on the cache cleanup interval to avoid keeping Node alive.

- **Web scraping governance + crawl behavior**
    - `src/mastra/tools/web-scraper-tool.ts`: added allowlist enforcement via `WEB_SCRAPER_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` (comma-separated domains). Requests outside the allowlist now fail with `DOMAIN_NOT_ALLOWED`.
    - `web:scraper`: `followLinks` now actually crawls internal links using Crawlee `enqueueLinks` with depth tracking.
    - Request tuning: retries/delay and headers/user-agent are applied consistently.

- **Code tools robustness**
    - `src/mastra/tools/code-search.tool.ts`: default ignore patterns (`node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`), safe regex compilation, and max file-size guard.
    - `src/mastra/tools/code-analysis.tool.ts`: supports directory targets; adds default ignore patterns; refactors file loop for readability/robustness.
    - `src/mastra/tools/multi-string-edit.tool.ts`: adds max file-size guard; invalid regex now returns a structured failed result instead of throwing.

## Dependency Audit Notes **[Dec 12]**

- **Keep (good, maintained choices)**
    - `ts-morph` (semantic TS/JS analysis)
    - `fast-glob` (file discovery)
    - `diff` (patch generation)
    - `crawlee` + `cheerio` (scraping/crawling)
    - `zod` (schemas)
    - `@opentelemetry/api` (tracing)

- **Consider tightening / de-duplicating**
    - **Motion libs**: you have both `framer-motion` and `motion` pinned to the same version. If only one is used, remove the other to reduce bundle risk.
    - **Monaco**: `@monaco-editor/react` is an `-rc` version; for production, prefer a stable tag unless you depend on the RC fixes.
    - **Multiple AI provider packages**: you have many `ai-sdk-provider-*` providers plus `@ai-sdk/*` packages. If some are unused, drop them to reduce supply-chain surface.

- **High-impact / caution**
    - `isolated-vm`: native dependency; can complicate Windows installs and serverless deploys. Keep only if you truly need strong sandboxing.
    - `playwright`: large + postinstall; keep if browser automation is needed; otherwise it materially increases install/CI time.

## Regex Hardening **[Dec 12]**

- Installed `re2` and wired it into tools that accept user-supplied regex:
    - `src/mastra/tools/code-search.tool.ts`: when `options.isRegex === true`, patterns compile using `re2` (RE2 engine).
    - `src/mastra/tools/multi-string-edit.tool.ts`: when `useRegex === true`, patterns compile using `re2`.

## npm Install Notes **[Dec 12]**

- `npm i re2` succeeded but reported peer warnings around `zod` version expectations for some AI SDK packages.
- `npm audit` reports **1 high severity vulnerability** (follow-up: review `npm audit` output and decide whether to run `npm audit fix` or pin/override).

## Monaco Editor **[Dec 12]**

- **Production worker/assets**
    - `app/components/monaco/theme-loader.ts`: configured Monaco loader to use `'/monaco/vs'`.
    - Manual asset copy: `node_modules/monaco-editor/min/vs` → `public/monaco/vs` (run once after install).
    - Postinstall script removed from package.json - assets now managed manually or via webpack plugin.

- **Webpack plugin (production builds)**
    - `next.config.ts`: added `monaco-editor-webpack-plugin` to client webpack config (languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, JSON, CSS, Markdown).
    - Note: Next 16 dev uses Turbopack (`next dev --turbopack`), so the webpack plugin primarily affects `next build`.

- **VS Code-style Workbench UI**
    - `app/components/monaco/MonacoWorkbench.tsx`: Complete VS Code-like layout with Explorer, Tabs, Editor, BottomPanel, and RightPanel.
    - `app/components/monaco/MonacoExplorer.tsx`: File explorer panel with file selection and new file creation.
    - `app/components/monaco/MonacoBottomPanel.tsx`: Bottom panel with terminal and problems tabs.
    - `app/components/monaco/MonacoRightPanel.tsx`: Right sidebar panel for workspace details.
    - State persistence: Files, active tab, theme, and view state (cursor/scroll) preserved across sessions via localStorage.
    - Tab management: Proper tab switching without editor remounts, view state preservation per tab.

- Add or update tests to cover new tools/agents and improve Vitest coverage (see `src/mastra` and `src/mastra/config/tests`), using `tests/test-results/test-results.json` as a baseline for tracking.
- Tighten alignment between AGENTS docs and actual code (ensure every documented agent/tool exists and vice versa).
- Expand evaluation and observability dashboards (Arize/Phoenix) using the existing exporters and scorer outputs.
- Flesh out the A2A coordinator’s orchestration story so that the MCP metadata and prompts reflect real, wired workflows rather than placeholders.

## Current Blockers / Risks

- Requires correct environment configuration (database connection, model API keys, financial API keys, `PHOENIX_ENDPOINT`/`PHOENIX_API_KEY`/`PHOENIX_PROJECT_NAME`, etc.) to exercise all capabilities.
- A2A coordination complexity grows with new agents; needs careful documentation and evaluation to avoid misalignment.
- JWT auth is currently stubbed; until verification is implemented and policies are enforced, flows that depend on strict auth should be treated as experimental.
