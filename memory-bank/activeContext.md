# Active Context

## Current Focus (Nov 2025)

- Keep the `/memory-bank` fully in sync with the actual AgentStack codebase so future sessions can trust it as the single source of truth.
- Maintain and gradually harden AgentStack’s Mastra-based multi-agent runtime (see `src/mastra/index.ts`), including the A2A coordinator agent and MCP server.
- Grow and stabilize Vitest test coverage for tools, config, and future workflows (tests exist but coverage is not yet a fixed target).

## Key Decisions

- Use `LibSQLStore` for local `mastra.db` storage in the Mastra bootstrap, while PgVector/Postgres is configured separately in `src/mastra/config/pg-storage.ts` and registered via `vectors: { pgVector }`.
- Centralize all agents (weather, research, stock analysis, csv/excalidraw conversions, learning extraction, evaluation, report, editor, copywriter, A2A coordinator) in `src/mastra/index.ts` for a single Mastra instance.
- Rely on Arize/Phoenix (via `ArizeExporter`) plus `CloudExporter` and `DefaultExporter` for observability, with always-on sampling configured in `mastra` options.
- Adopt the Kiro-Lite workflow (`.github/prompts/kiro-lite.prompt.md`) and `/memory-bank` instructions as the default way to plan and implement new features (PRD → design → tasks → code), including the `/update memory bank` flow.

## Work in Progress

- Refining agent documentation (`src/mastra/agents/AGENTS.md`) and tool catalog (`src/mastra/tools/AGENTS.md`) to ensure they accurately reflect implemented files.
- Using the memory bank for project continuity and future feature planning (feature templates live under `memory-bank/feature-template/`).
- Iterating on the A2A coordinator and MCP server: current resource metadata and prompts are largely placeholders; future work will connect them more tightly to real workflows and agents.
- Implementing and wiring real JWT verification for the `jwt-auth` tool and ensuring RBAC policies in `src/mastra/policy/acl.yaml` are enforced where appropriate.
